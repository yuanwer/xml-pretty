## Introduction

xml-pretty is a web-based tool for formatting and displaying XML documents.

One day, a friend of mine joined a company where XML was used for data exchange between the frontend and backend. During a debugging session, I noticed that the existing XML formatting tools they were using had their own shortcomings.

This inspired me to develop a tool that combines the best features from different existing tools. ‚úä

## Features

I wanted xml-pretty to focus specifically on XML formatting, avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary features. This keeps the tool lightweight and user-friendly.

### Current Features

Currently, xml-pretty provides the following features, as long as your XML format is correct ‚úî. It aims to deliver satisfactory results:

1. XML formatting: The basic feature of indenting and structuring XML code.
2. XML compression: Removing unnecessary line breaks and white spaces, reducing file size.
3. Content memory: When you reopen xml-pretty, it remembers and displays the last XML content you entered.

### Planned Features

Some features are in the pipeline and will be released soon, while others...

1. XML diff comparison: Comparing and highlighting the differences between two XML documents.
2. User-controlled content memory: Allowing users to enable or disable the content memory feature.

## Final Thoughts

You might be wondering why you should choose XML-Pretty when there are already many similar tools available online.

Indeed, there are numerous similar tools on the internet, and some of them might fulfill your requirements perfectly. However, what sets XML-Pretty apart from most of these tools is that it is open-source. This means you can review its source code, ensuring there are no potential privacy issues or data leakage risks. Your inputted XML data (or any other content) is not logged or stored, whether it's your company's business data or personal information.

In modern development, the use of XML is becoming less common. Except for some special scenarios, most developers around me no longer choose XML for data exchange and storage.

If you happen to be working with XML, I hope XML-Pretty can provide you with a smoother experience.

Best of luck! üéâ
